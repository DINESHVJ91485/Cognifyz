    <p>A place set apart to contain books, periodicals, and other material for reading, viewing, listening, study, or reference,<br>  as a room, set of rooms, or building where may be read or borrowed.</p>
    <p>Library, traditionally, collection of books used for reading or study, or the building or room in which such a collection<br>is kept.The word derives from the Latin liber, “book,” whereas a Latinized Greek word, bibliotheca, is the origin of the<br>word for library in, German, Russian, and the Romance languages.
    <p>From their historical beginnings as places to keep the business, legal, historical, and religious records of a civilization,<br>libraries have emerged since the middle of 20th century as a far-reaching body of information resources and services<br> that do not even require a building. Rapid developments in computers, telecommunications, and other technologies<br>have made it possible to store and retrieve information in many different forms and from any place with a computer<br> and a telephone connection.
    <p>"A library is not a Luxury but one of the Necessities of Life" - Henry Ward Beecher.
